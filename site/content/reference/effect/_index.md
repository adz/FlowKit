This page shows the `Effect<'value, 'error>` shape and the `EffectFlow` module. An effect is the deferred execution handle returned by `Flow.run`; on .NET it is a `ValueTask<Exit<'v, 'e>>` and on Fable it is an `Async<Exit<'v, 'e>>`. Use the `EffectFlow` functions for low-level algebra and for bridging between the unified flow surface and platform-native async primitives.

## Core type

- [`Effect`](./t-effect.md): 
 Represents the portable execution shape used by the unified <a href="https://adz.github.io/FsFlow/reference/FsFlow/fsflow-flow-3.html">Flow</a>.
