An accumulating validation result that keeps the structured diagnostics graph visible.


```fsharp
type Validation<'value, 'error>
```


## Remarks

Unlike `FSharpResult`, this type is designed for applicative
composition using `and!` in the `validate { }` builder, which merges errors instead of
short-circuiting.
