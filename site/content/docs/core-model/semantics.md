This page shows the exact execution rules for `Flow`, including how a cold program becomes an `Effect` and resolves to an `Exit`.

FsFlow uses a unified [**`Flow<'env, 'error, 'value>`**]({{< relref "/reference/flow/t-flow.md" >}}) model that handles synchronous code, F# `Async`, and .NET `Task` interop natively.

## Execution Shape

Conceptually, execution is:

`Flow -> Effect -> Exit`

More precisely:

- `Flow` is the cold program you define.
- `Effect` is the deferred runnable carrier.
- `Exit` is the terminal outcome after execution.

## Success and Typed Failure

Every Flow execution results in an [**`Exit<'value, 'error>`**]({{< relref "/reference/flow/t-flow.md" >}}):

- `Exit.Success value`: The happy path.
- `Exit.Failure (Cause.Fail error)`: An expected domain-specific failure.
- `Exit.Failure Cause.Interrupt`: The workflow was signaled to stop (e.g., cancellation).
- `Exit.Failure (Cause.Die exception)`: An unexpected defect or crash. `Flow.run`, `Flow.runFull`, and `Flow.runSync` preserve uncaught exceptions in this branch.

All standard combinators (`map`, `bind`, `zip`, `orElse`) are **short-circuiting**. The first `Exit.Failure` stops the workflow unless explicitly caught.

## Short-Circuiting vs. Accumulated Validation

- [**`flow {}`**]({{< relref "/reference/flow/builders-flow.md" >}}) and **`result {}`**: Ordered workflows. They stop on the first failure.
- [**`validate {}`**]({{< relref "/reference/validation/builders-validate.md" >}}): Accumulating validation. Joins errors from independent steps (using `and!`) into a structured `Diagnostics` graph.

Use the short-circuiting model when later steps depend on earlier values. Use the validation model when independent checks should all run and report back together.

## Execution Is Explicit

You run a Flow by calling [`Flow.run`]({{< relref "/reference/flow/m-flow-run.md" >}}). 

`Flow.run` returns an **`Effect<'value, 'error>`**. The platform-specific carrier is defined by the target:

- On **.NET**: `Effect<'value, 'error>` is a `ValueTask<Exit<'value, 'error>>`.
- On **Fable**: `Effect<'value, 'error>` is an `Async<Exit<'value, 'error>>`.

This design allows FsFlow to remain portable while respecting the execution models of different platforms. `Effect` is the cross-platform execution handle.

A flow is **cold**: building a flow does not run it. Each call to `run` executes the logic from scratch.

## Success and Failure Causes

FsFlow distinguishes between expected failures, administrative signals, and unexpected defects. For a detailed explanation of the architectural rationale behind this split, see [**Defects and Exceptions**]({{< relref "defects.md" >}}).

## Interruption and Cancellation

FsFlow supports algebraic interruption. When a [**Fiber**]({{< relref "fibers.md" >}}) is interrupted (e.g., via `Flow.interrupt` or a `CancellationToken` trigger), the flow stops executing and returns `Exit.Failure Cause.Interrupt`.

## Environments

Flow reads dependencies explicitly:

- `Flow.env`: Reads the whole environment.
- `Flow.read`: Projects one dependency.
- `Flow.localEnv`: Runs a smaller computation inside a larger environment.

## Task Temperature

Flow distinguishes between:

- **Hot Inputs**: Already-started `Task<'value>` or `Async<'value>`. Re-running the flow re-awaits the same underlying work.
- **Cold Inputs**: Logic defined inside `flow {}` or helpers like `Flow.Runtime.sleep`. Re-running the flow repeats the work.

Use Cold inputs when you want the effect to observe the runtime `CancellationToken` or repeat its side effects on retry.

## Runtime Helpers

Operational helpers for logging, timeout, retry, and resource handling are grouped into the `Flow.Runtime` and `Schedule` modules.
