This page shows the `flow { }` computation expression, the primary syntax for writing FsFlow workflows. Inside the builder, ordinary values, `Result`, `Async`, `Task`, `Flow`, and guarded sources can be sequenced without manually unwrapping each layer. The builder preserves the important boundaries: expected errors stay typed, defects become `Cause.Die`, cancellation becomes interruption, and environment access remains explicit through `Flow.env` or `Flow.read`. Prefer `flow { }` for application orchestration; keep pure validation and simple predicates in `Check`, `Validation`, or `Result` until the code needs environment or effects.
