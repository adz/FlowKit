Describes the capability contract for a single dependency.


```fsharp
type Needs<'dep>
```


## Remarks

Named cap-set interfaces inherit this contract once and then expose the dependency through a
member such as `Clock` or `Logger`. Workflow builders can accept any environment
that implements `Needs&lt;'dep&gt;`, which lets larger runtimes satisfy smaller
boundaries.
