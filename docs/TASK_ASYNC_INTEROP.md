# Task and Async Interop

This page shows the direct binding surface for async work and helps you choose the right FsFlow family.

Task-oriented APIs on this page belong to the main `FsFlow` package.
The core package includes sync, async, and task concepts together.

## The Main Rule

Choose the boundary shape that matches the runtime shape of the code itself:

- Flow for synchronous boundaries
- direct `Async` binding when the computation already uses F#
- direct `.NET Task` binding when the computation is task-oriented

Use interop to cross boundaries.
Avoid keeping a task-oriented boundary in Flow just because a helper can be adapted.

Use Check for reusable predicates, `Check.orError` for pure failure-to-error bridging,
`Guard.Of` / `Guard.MapError` when the source is already effect-shaped and you want the CE to
bind the source while preserving its attached error,
Result for fail-fast validation, and Validation plus [`validate {}`]({{< relref "builders-validate.md" >}}) when sibling failures should accumulate.

## Preferred Style Inside Computation Expressions

Inside `flow {}`, prefer direct binding:

```fsharp
flow {
    let! user = loadUser
    do! validateUser user
    let! suffix = coldSuffix
    return user.Name + suffix
}
```

The builder already binds Result, Flow, `Async`, `Task`, `ValueTask`, and `ColdTask` where supported.
That means normal docs examples should prefer direct `let!` binding over explicit bridge helpers unless the point of the example is the bridge API itself.

## Direct Binds At A Glance

These are the values you can usually drop directly into `let!` in each builder.
The option and value-option cases bind directly only when the computation error type is `unit`.

| Builder | Binds directly |
| --- | --- |
| `flow {}` | `Flow<'env, 'error, 'value>`, `Result<'value, 'error>`, `option<'value>` when `error = unit`, `voption<'value>` when `error = unit`, `Async<'value>`, `Async<Result<'value, 'error>>`, `Task<'value>`, `Task<Result<'value, 'error>>`, `ValueTask<'value>`, `ValueTask<Result<'value, 'error>>`, `ColdTask<'value>`, `ColdTask<Result<'value, 'error>>` |

### `flow {}`

The builder binds:

- `Flow<'env, 'error, 'value>`
- `Result<'value, 'error>`
- `Option<'value>` when the error type is `unit`
- `ValueOption<'value>` when the error type is `unit`

Use [`flow {}`]({{< relref "builders-flow.md" >}}) when the body is synchronous.
Use `<!>` for mapping a pure function over a Result or flow value.
Use `<*>` only when the function is already inside the same Result or flow shape.

Example:

```fsharp
let computation : Flow<unit, string, string> =
    flow {
        let! a = async { return "a" }
        let! b = Task.FromResult "b"
        return a + b
    }
```

## When Explicit Lifting Still Matters

For some types you only get the direct bind when the computation error type can stay `unit`.
Use an explicit lift when you want to choose the error value yourself.

For example, `option<'value>` can bind directly in a `unit`-error computation:

```fsharp
let maybeName : string option = None

let autoLifted : Flow<unit, unit, string> =
    flow {
        let! name = maybeName
        return name
    }
```

If you want a typed error such as `"name is required"`, use `Flow.fromOption` instead:

```fsharp
let maybeName : string option = None

let typedError : Flow<unit, string, string> =
    flow {
        let! name = maybeName |> Flow.fromOption "name is required"
        return name
    }
```

Another approach to the same shape is to use `Check.orError` directly:

```fsharp
let typedError : Flow<unit, string, string> =
    flow {
        let! name = maybeName |> Check.okIfSome |> Check.orError "name is required"
        return name
    }
```

For applicative code, keep the distinction clear: `<!>` lifts a pure function into the same shape as the value, and `<*>` applies a function that has already been lifted.

## When To Choose Flow For Async

Prefer Flow when:

- the outer application code already uses `Async`
- you want to stay in core `FsFlow`
- `Async` is the execution model for the computation

## When To Choose Flow For Task

Prefer Flow when:

- the public boundary is `.NET Task`
- task interop is central to the computation
- runtime cancellation belongs in execution
- `Task` is the execution model for the computation.

Use `Flow.Runtime` for shared operational helpers like `sleep`, `timeout`, `retry`, and `useWithAcquireRelease`.

Use `FsFlow.Check` for pure `Result<'value, unit>` validation.
Use `Check.orError` when you want to turn a unit failure into a domain error.
Use Validation and [`validate {}`]({{< relref "builders-validate.md" >}}) when the checks should accumulate.

The builder binds Result directly, so extra bridge calls are only needed when the error value itself needs a different conversion shape.
When the source itself should bind directly in `flow`, wrap it with `Guard.Of` or remap the existing error with `Guard.MapError`. The source stays visible to the CE; Guard only packages the failure value.

## `ColdTask<'value>`

`ColdTask<'value>` is the delayed task shape used by the task surface:

```fsharp
CancellationToken -> Task<'value>
```

Use it when a helper can stay task-based but delayed until the boundary runs.

Example:

```fsharp
let readAll path : ColdTask<string> =
    ColdTask(fun ct -> System.IO.File.ReadAllTextAsync(path, ct))

let computation : Flow<unit, string, string> =
    flow {
        let! text = readAll "config.json"
        return text
    }
```

## Hot `Task` And `ValueTask` Versus ColdTask

Binding a started `Task<'value>` or `ValueTask<'value>` is not the same as binding a `ColdTask<'value>`.

Started task inputs are hot:

- the work may already be running before the boundary starts
- rerunning the boundary re-awaits the same started work
- the current cancellation token cannot be pushed into that work after the fact

ColdTask inputs are cold:

- the work starts when the boundary runs
- rerunning the boundary starts the work again from scratch
- the current cancellation token is passed into the ColdTask factory

Use a direct `Task` or `ValueTask` bind when you intentionally want to reuse existing started work.

Use ColdTask when the task helper is part of the boundary effect and can stay delayed, restartable, and cancellation-aware.

Example with a started task:

```fsharp
let started = Task.FromResult 42

let computation : Flow<unit, string, int> =
    flow {
        let! value = started
        return value
    }
```

Example with delayed task work:

```fsharp
let loadValue : ColdTask<int> =
    ColdTask(fun cancellationToken ->
        Task.FromResult 42)

let computation : Flow<unit, string, int> =
    flow {
        let! value = loadValue
        return value
    }
```

Read [`docs/SEMANTICS.md`](./SEMANTICS.md) when you need the exact rerun and cancellation behavior.

## Choosing Quickly

Use:

- Flow when the boundary is sync
- Flow when the boundary is `Async`-first
- Flow when the boundary is `Task`-first
- `ColdTask<'value>` when a task helper can stay delayed, rerunnable, and cancellable at run time

If you are unsure between Flow and Flow, choose the one that matches the boundary you
need to return and run today.
